## What Is Kyro?

Kyro is an **agent-agnostic workflow kit** for iterative AI-assisted development. It gives any capable coding agent a shared operating model for analysis, sprint planning, implementation, review, context handoff, and learned rules.

Kyro is portable because its source of truth is plain markdown:

- **Orchestrator instructions** in `agents/orchestrator.md`
- **Reusable skills** in `skills/sprint-forge/` and `skills/qa-review/`
- **Workflow intents** in `commands/`
- **Project state** in `.agents/sprint-forge/{scope}/`

Claude Code has a native adapter through `.claude-plugin/`. Other agents can use the same core files manually or through their own project-rule/context mechanisms.

---

## Core Workflow

```
[ANALYZE]  → investigate the project or scope
    ↓
[PLAN]     → generate or update roadmap and sprint tasks
    ↓
[EXECUTE]  → implement task by task with checkpoints
    ↓
[REVIEW]   → validate quality, architecture, debt, and docs
    ↓
[WRAP-UP]  → update retro, re-entry prompts, and learned rules
```

Kyro has three stable workflow intents:

| Intent | Native slash command | Manual equivalent |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| `forge` | `/kyro-workflow:forge` | Analyze, plan, execute, review, and close the sprint |
| `status` | `/kyro-workflow:status` | Read project artifacts and report progress/debt |
| `wrap-up` | `/kyro-workflow:wrap-up` | Close the session and update re-entry context |

Platforms without slash commands should ask the agent to perform the matching manual equivalent while referencing the orchestrator and skill files.

---

## Integration Levels

| Level | Platforms | What Works | Notes |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Native adapter | Claude Code | Commands, agent, skills, and Claude plugin metadata | `.claude-plugin/` is adapter packaging, not Kyro's core |
| Manual adapter | Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, generic AGENTS-style agents | Copy or reference orchestrator and skills as project context | Artifact updates depend on the agent following instructions |
| Programmatic adapter | Any LLM API | Load markdown instructions into prompts/system messages | Provider integration is owned by the host application |

Kyro does not claim native integration for Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, or other agents unless a verified adapter exists. Compatibility comes from portable markdown files and stable artifact conventions.

---

## Generic Agent Setup

For agents without native Kyro support, copy or symlink the core files into the target project:

```bash
mkdir -p .skills .agents .agents/sprint-forge

cp -r /path/to/kyro-workflow/skills/sprint-forge .skills/
cp -r /path/to/kyro-workflow/skills/qa-review .skills/
cp /path/to/kyro-workflow/agents/orchestrator.md .agents/
```

Then provide this context to the agent:

```text
Use Kyro for this project.

Read:
- .agents/orchestrator.md
- .skills/sprint-forge/SKILL.md
- .skills/qa-review/SKILL.md

Use .agents/sprint-forge/{scope}/ for ROADMAP.md, findings, sprints,
RE-ENTRY-PROMPTS.md, handoffs, and learned rules.

If slash commands are unsupported:
- forge = analyze/plan/execute/review/close the sprint
- status = read artifacts and report progress/debt
- wrap-up = close the session and update re-entry prompts
```

---

## Claude Code Adapter

Claude Code is currently the only native plugin adapter included in this package.

```bash
/plugin marketplace add SynapSync/kyro-workflow
/plugin install kyro-workflow@kyro-workflow
```

Local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SynapSync/kyro-workflow.git
cd kyro-workflow
npm install && npm run build
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/kyro-workflow
```

The Claude adapter lives in `.claude-plugin/`. Core Kyro behavior remains in markdown assets shared by all agents.

---

## Architecture

```
User intent
  └── Orchestrator instructions
        ├── sprint-forge skill
        ├── qa-review skill
        └── markdown project artifacts
```

```
kyro-workflow/
├── agents/
│   └── orchestrator.md
├── commands/
│   ├── forge.md
│   ├── status.md
│   └── wrap-up.md
├── skills/
│   ├── sprint-forge/
│   └── qa-review/
├── docs/
├── rules/
├── templates/
├── config.json
└── .claude-plugin/       # Claude Code adapter only
```

---

## Project Artifacts

Kyro persists workflow state in markdown artifacts:

```
.agents/sprint-forge/
├── rules.md
└── {scope}/
    ├── README.md
    ├── ROADMAP.md
    ├── RE-ENTRY-PROMPTS.md
    ├── findings/
    ├── sprints/
    └── handoffs/
```

This is the stable public interface. Any agent can inspect, modify, diff, and continue from these files.

---

## Configuration

`config.json` is intentionally small:

```json
{
  "rules": { "path": ".agents/sprint-forge/rules.md", "auto_load": true },
  "quality_gates": { "typecheck": "npm run typecheck", "build": "npm run build" },
  "sprint": { "checkpoint_per_phase": true, "require_retro": true, "debt_aged_threshold_sprints": 3 }
}
```

Kyro does not enforce model selection. Use the strongest available model for implementation and debugging. Lighter models are acceptable for read-only analysis, status reporting, or documentation review.

## Philosophy

1. **Markdown is the interface** — portability comes from files, not a runtime service.
2. **Investigate before planning** — analysis gates prevent shallow sprint plans.
3. **One sprint at a time** — each sprint adapts from the previous retro and debt.
4. **Checkpoints protect continuity** — progress must survive agent/session changes.
5. **Debt never disappears** — debt changes status only when explicitly resolved.
6. **The plan serves execution** — roadmaps adapt to reality.
