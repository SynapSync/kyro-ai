## What Kyro AI Does

Kyro AI installs a project-local workflow harness that helps AI coding agents analyze, plan, execute, review, and close software work through repeatable sprint cycles.

It is designed for teams that switch between agents and do not want every agent to relearn the workflow from a giant prompt.

Kyro gives agents:

- a **managed core** with orchestrator, command, skill, and template instructions
- **command-like skills** such as `kyro-forge`, `kyro-status`, and `kyro-wrap-up`
- **a single source of truth per scope** — one `sprint.json` holding objective, success criteria, roadmap, the active sprint, debt, conventions, and handoff routing
- **zero-loss archives** — every closed sprint is snapshotted verbatim before it is cleared
- **deterministic CLI gates** (`doctor`, `analyze`) so quality is enforced in code, not left to prompt discipline

---

## Quick Start

Install Kyro AI into the current project:

```bash
npx kyro-ai install --agent opencode,codex --scope workspace --yes
npx kyro-ai doctor
```

Use one agent only if needed:

```bash
npx kyro-ai install --agent opencode --scope workspace --yes
npx kyro-ai install --agent codex --scope workspace --yes
```

After install, open your agent and invoke the installed Kyro command skill:

```text
kyro-forge auth-refactor
```

Other installed command skills:

```text
kyro-status
kyro-wrap-up
```

If the host exposes slash commands, the equivalent public command namespace is:

```text
/kyro:forge
/kyro:status
/kyro:wrap-up
```

---

## Installed Layout

Kyro separates global runtime from project state. Runtime files live in your user-level agents directory; project files keep only state and artifacts.

Global runtime:

```text
~/.agents/
├── kyro/
│   ├── versions/
│   │   └── {version}/
│   │       ├── core/
│   │       │   ├── agents/
│   │       │   ├── config.json
│   │       │   └── WORKFLOW.yaml
│   │       ├── commands/
│   │       ├── skills/
│   │       │   ├── sprint-forge/
│   │       │   └── qa-review/
│   │       ├── KYRO.md
│   │       └── manifest.json
│   └── current -> versions/{version}
└── skills/
    ├── kyro-forge/SKILL.md
    ├── kyro-status/SKILL.md
    └── kyro-wrap-up/SKILL.md
```

Project state and artifacts (v4 — one `sprint.json` per scope):

```text
<project>/
└── .agents/
    └── kyro/
        ├── kyro.json                    # registry: scopes[], activeScope, principles[]
        └── scopes/
            └── {scope}/
                ├── sprint.json          # single source of truth
                ├── archive/             # write-only, at sprint close
                │   ├── sprint-001-slug.json   # verbatim zero-loss snapshot
                │   └── sprint-001-slug.md      # human narrative
                └── findings/            # write-only INIT analysis evidence
                    └── 01-slug.md
```

Important invariant: `kyro install` creates the root project state at `.agents/kyro/kyro.json`. Each scope's `sprint.json` is created by `/kyro:forge` (INIT). The only per-scope files are `sprint.json` plus the write-only `archive/` and `findings/`.

## Who Invokes Whom

```text
User
  ↓
kyro / kyro-ai CLI
  ↓
installs managed core + adapter projections
  ↓
agent opens the project
  ↓
agent discovers AGENTS.md and/or ~/.agents/skills
  ↓
user invokes kyro-forge / kyro-status / kyro-wrap-up
  ↓
projected skill reads ~/.agents/kyro/current/commands/*.md
  ↓
orchestrator reads ~/.agents/kyro/current/core/agents/orchestrator.md
  ↓
sprint-forge skill assets guide the workflow
  ↓
artifacts are written under <project>/.agents/kyro/scopes/{scope}/
```

The user should not have to explain the workflow in natural language. If an agent cannot discover the installed command skills, that agent needs a better adapter.

## CLI Reference

Kyro AI exposes two equivalent bins:

```bash
kyro
kyro-ai
```

Commands:

| Command             | Purpose                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `kyro`              | Open the basic interactive configuration TUI                                   |
| `kyro install`      | Install managed core and selected agent adapters                               |
| `kyro doctor`       | Validate package health, workspace state, artifacts, and adapters              |
| `kyro analyze`      | Semantic cross-check of a scope (clarity, coverage, dependencies, debt, principles) |
| `kyro close-sprint` | Snapshot + close the active sprint (zero-loss, tool-owned)                      |
| `kyro repair`       | Validate and normalize a scope's `sprint.json`                                 |
| `kyro context-pack` | Emit a summary-first context package for a scope                               |
| `kyro scope`        | List, inspect, or set the active Kyro scope                                    |
| `kyro sync`         | Refresh managed assets without rewriting unmanaged files                       |
| `kyro uninstall`    | Remove managed workspace assets                                                |

Common usage:

```bash
kyro install --agent opencode,codex --scope workspace --yes
kyro doctor --tokens --artifacts
kyro analyze --kyro-scope auth-refactor
kyro close-sprint --kyro-scope auth-refactor --outcome shipped --learning "..."
kyro sync --agent codex --dry-run
```

Supported install adapters today:

| Adapter    | Status                            | What it installs                                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `opencode` | Implemented                       | `~/.agents/skills/kyro-*` command skill projections                     |
| `codex`    | Implemented                       | `~/.agents/skills/kyro-*` plus a managed Kyro block in root `AGENTS.md` |
| `claude`   | Planned for CLI workspace install | Claude plugin remains first-class through `.claude-plugin/`           |
| `cursor`   | Planned                           | Not installed by the CLI yet                                          |

There is intentionally no `generic` adapter. Cross-agent instructions belong in root `AGENTS.md`; install adapters should target concrete agent capabilities.

## Artifact Integrity

Kyro treats the repo as the system of record. Validate and repair the knowledge contract with:

```bash
kyro doctor --artifacts
kyro analyze --kyro-scope <scope>
kyro repair --kyro-scope <scope> --yes
kyro scope inspect <scope>
```

`doctor --artifacts` validates `sprint.json` shape, zero-loss snapshots, archive narratives, and unresolved `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers. `analyze` adds a severity-triaged semantic pass (coverage, dependencies, overdue debt, principle violations). `repair` re-parses and normalizes `sprint.json` without rewriting user-authored archives.

## Core Workflow

Kyro has three stable workflow intents:

| Intent  | Skill / command                  | What it does                                                    |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Forge   | `kyro-forge` / `/kyro:forge`     | Analyze, plan, execute, review, and close a sprint cycle        |
| Status  | `kyro-status` / `/kyro:status`   | Report project progress, roadmap health, and technical debt     |
| Wrap-up | `kyro-wrap-up` / `/kyro:wrap-up` | Close a session, update handoff context, and preserve learnings |

Forge is routed deterministically by state, not by guesswork:

```text
read kyro.json + scopes/{scope}/sprint.json
  → route on sprint.json.handoff.nextAction
    (init → clarify → plan → execute → review → close, or recover)
  → load only the selected mode/helper/template
  → one safe-write back to sprint.json
```

Kyro is intentionally sprint-by-sprint and single-source. It loads two files to start (`kyro.json` + `sprint.json`) and updates one file per action — it never pre-loads every roadmap, sprint, helper, and template just to decide the next move. Unknowns are surfaced as `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers and resolved by the `clarify` mode before planning — the agent admits what it does not know instead of guessing.

---

## Architecture

The source package is organized around portable markdown instructions plus a small deterministic CLI:

```text
kyro-ai/
├── src/cli/                 # installer, doctor, sync, uninstall, adapters
├── agents/                  # orchestrator instruction
├── commands/                # forge, status, wrap-up command definitions
├── skills/
│   ├── sprint-forge/        # main workflow skill and assets
│   └── qa-review/           # senior QA review skill
├── docs/                    # architecture, CLI, adapter, and command docs
├── rules/                   # reusable operating rules
├── templates/               # context templates
├── .claude-plugin/          # Claude plugin adapter packaging
├── WORKFLOW.yaml
└── config.json
```

Runtime contract:

| Layer           | Responsibility                                                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CLI             | Install, sync, uninstall, validate, and project managed files                 |
| Adapter         | Translate Kyro into each agent's native/compatible instruction surface        |
| Projected skill | Give the agent a short command entrypoint without duplicating lifecycle prose |
| Orchestrator    | Coordinate phases, gates, review, debugging, and handoff                      |
| Sprint Forge skill | Define workflow modes, helpers, templates, and discipline rules |
| Artifacts       | Persist objective, roadmap, active sprint, debt, conventions, and handoff in one `sprint.json` per scope, plus write-only archives |

---

## Claude Plugin Support

Claude remains first-class.

The Claude plugin adapter lives in `.claude-plugin/` and is shipped with the package. The CLI workspace installer does not replace the Claude plugin; it complements it for agents that need workspace-local command skills and `AGENTS.md` instructions.

Claude plugin install:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add SynapSync/kyro-ai
/plugin install kyro-ai@kyro-ai
```

Local plugin development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SynapSync/kyro-ai.git
cd kyro-ai
npm install
npm run build
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/kyro-ai
```

---

## Development

Requirements:

- Node.js 18+
- npm

Useful commands:

```bash
npm ci
npm run check
npm run build
npm pack --dry-run
```

`npm run check` runs:

- TypeScript typecheck
- package/plugin/workflow version validation
- relative markdown link validation
- runtime-artifact gate (runtime must speak only the `sprint.json` model)
- `dist/` freshness, budget-manifest, and v4 sprint-doctor fixtures

Release tags publish to npm through GitHub Actions when the tag matches `package.json.version`:

```bash
git tag v4.1.0
git push origin v4.1.0
```

The release workflow expects the repository secret `NPM_TOKEN`.

---

## Generated Artifacts and Release Process

`dist/` is a generated artifact built from `src/` by `npm run build`. It must stay in sync with source, so releases cannot pack stale generated output.

Before committing or releasing:

```bash
npm run check      # includes check:dist
npm run build
npm run check:adapters
npm pack --dry-run
```

- `npm run check:dist` proves the committed `dist/` matches a fresh build.
- `npm run check:adapters` validates adapter projections against the built runtime.
- `npm pack --dry-run` simulates the published tarball only after the gates above pass.

See [`docs/release-checklist.md`](docs/release-checklist.md) for the full maintainer checklist and CI gate ordering.

---


## Cost Model

Kyro uses lean runtime loading: command router → `sprint.json` state → one routed mode → only required helpers. Task evidence is recorded directly on the task object in `sprint.json`; at sprint close the CLI writes the verbatim snapshot and a human narrative to `archive/`. See [docs/cost-model.md](docs/cost-model.md).

## Philosophy

1. **Commands over prose** — users should invoke workflows, not explain them repeatedly.
2. **Markdown remains the collaboration layer** — humans and agents can inspect the same artifacts.
3. **The CLI owns deterministic checks** — package health should not depend on prompt discipline.
4. **Adapters are concrete** — each supported agent gets the files it actually knows how to use.
5. **One sprint at a time** — each cycle adapts from evidence, retro, and technical debt.
6. **Claude stays first-class** — multi-agent support does not mean retiring the Claude plugin.
